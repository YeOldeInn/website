YeOldeInn website wat
=====================

Yeah, so I've restarted this projects half a dozen times or more because I
keep running head-long into something that just isn't going to work for some
reason. The end result is a fair bit of work on my part and not a whole lot to
show for it. Which sucks. So it seems like the real solution is to start
putting stuff in git and let other people poke at it too.

Yes, that means it's going to suck, especially since I'm not actually writing
any CSS yet. Let's get the content sorted out first.


So what's the problem exactly?
------------------------------

The first problem is … YeOldeInn isn't one website. It's like 14 … 15, 16, 18
websites. Most of them are near copies of each other in languages I don't
speak. We're going to do something *else* about translations later. I … have
no idea what yet, but there are "right" ways to do it and … what we have now
isn't really one of them unless you have a translation team (and even then
it's not ideal.)

The next problem is … what goes where? There's … many gigabytes. Like when I
started on this, there was 24GB of HQ content and a smattering of ancient PHP
and table-layout HTML that barely knows what CSS is.


How you can help
----------------

Hit up the wiki and the forum on YeOldeInn to join the discussions for what
goes where and how to handle the content. Right now we're not really doing CSS
at all really, just content. Styling it is (relatively) easy once we have some
content.
